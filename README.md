# MostIsolated

Scala project that finds the most isolated feature inside a 2D plane. The most isolated feature has been defined by having the largest Euclidean distance.

Examples can be found inside 'MostIsolated\data'. Every line in those files defines a feature. They have a name, an x coordinate and a y coordinate. These were provided for this project and so the program must be able to read this format.
