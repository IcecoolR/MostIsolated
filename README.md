# MostIsolated

Scala project that finds the most isolated feature inside a 2D plane. 
An isolated feature is defined by the largest Euclidian distance.
Look at the examples inside 'MostIsolated\data' to find the format that the program needs to read files. Each feature is on a new line, and has a name, x coordinate and y coordinate.
